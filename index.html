        <h2>"Zines have an enormous variety. They’re experimental and diverse. This gives them a freshness and surprise. They’re anti-formalist. They’re relatable”</h2>

        <p>Digital will reflect more qualities that make print great. </p>
        <p> Specifically quarterly magazines and zines. Quarterlies are a pleasure to read, with variety in layout and pacing. They're beautiful to hold.
        <p>They're less frequent, and much better. Even the ads are well crafted, and trusted.</p>
        <p class="example"> Example: </p>
        <p class="break"> Posture + Anxy</p>

        <p class="a1">Enormous variety</p>
        <p class="a2">Experimental and diverse</p>
        <p class="a3">Relateable</p>
        <p class="a4">Freshness and surprise</p>
        <p class="a5">Anti-formalist</p>
        <p>Are these qualities possible in digital? (Why don't we see more of them) Digital is expressive and relateable. But most sites look the same.</p>
        <p class="weird"> IT CAN BE WEIRD AND WONDERFUL.</p>
        <p>See: bloopdance.com</p>
        <p>Here's a recent example. Internetting with Amanda Hess by the New York Times. Art Direction is 100 100</p>
        <p>The variety of layout and pacing keeps it interesting to consume. It is experimental. It is both serious + playful. It is deep and it is poppy. They are incredibly well made and fresh. The best of quarterlies and zines.</p>
        <p>News media will adopt these qualities. It will be a strategic advantage.</p>
        <p>Thank you, Kawandeed</p>
