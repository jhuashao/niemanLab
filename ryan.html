        <p class="a2">First it was a story.</p>
        <p class="a3">Then a moment.</p>
		<p>Now, two months after women began to come forward in droves to accuse powerful men of sexual harassment and assault, it is a movement.</p>
		<p>Time magazine has named the silence breakers” its person of the year for 2017, referring to those women, and the global conversation they have started.</p>

        <p>Reporters and radio and television hosts. Film producers. A US senator and other members of Congress. Candidates for office and leaders of startups. By now, you'd have to be living under a rock not to see the impact the accusations of workplace harassment and assault are having on industry, culture and politics. Time Magazine has named the "Silence Breakers" its person of the year. Politicians have resigned from office or are choosing not to run again. Americans everywhere are driving themselves crazy asking: What do we do next? How can we fix this problem? Do we need new hiring practices, better HR procedures?</p>
        <p>Matt Lauer, Mark Halperin, Charlie Rose, and all the other fallen sexual harassers had one thing in common. They were notorious assholes. (See Venn diagram below.</p>

        <p>They yelled at people, belittled staff in front of colleagues, threatened, bullied, interrupted, mocked, and generally threw their weight around. We thought it was the price to pay for the talent of great men. Maybe being an asshole was even a sign of great talent.</p>
        <p>It was a sign, all right. A sign that something was very, very wrong. And the price? Toxic workplaces, talent drain, skewed covering, lawsuits, long-term damage to news organizations' reputation and credibility, and loss of revenue from advertisers, subscribers, and members.</p>
        <p>There's actually a simpler way to screen for many sexual harassers: Use interviews, background checks, trial periods and other employee selection methods. And just don't hire the jerks.</p>
        <p>When it comes to hiring and protecting yourself and others from workplace jerks, remember Leonardo da Vinci's advice that, "It is easier to resist at the beginning than the end." Do your homework before offering that star a job; someone else's problem soon become yours. And if you make a mistake and hire demeaning, selfish and disrespectful jerks, call them out on their behavior early and often. If that doesn't work, send them packing.</p>

        <p>There has been an explosion in recent years of academic research on workplace bullying and incivility. For example, a search of Google Scholar reveals more than 7,000 academic articles that have been published on abusive supervision since 2007. The careful studies that underpin Christine Porath's 2017 bookMastering Civility and my "Asshole Survival Guide" show that bullying and rudeness harm employees' mental and physical health (including increased risk of heart attacks and death); damage relationships with friends and family; cause the best employees to quit; undermine employee effort, productivity and creativity; and erode empathy for and service to clients and customers.</p>
        <p>Certified assholes not only put your health, most precious relationships, and performance at risk. When they are outed and ousted, the guilt by association may mean that the stain spreads to you and ruins your career, too.</p>
        <p>Prediction: In 2018, newsrooms adopt a no-assholes rule. </p>
        <p class="a4">You want to be an asshole? </p>
        <p class="a5">Sorry, you can't work here.</p>
        <p>(Credit for inventing the No Asshole Rule goes to Stanford professor Robert I. Sutton.)</p>
